## [1.8.9-0.16.0] - 25.07.2023
### Note on API keys ❗
In case you haven't heard yet: player-based API keys are currently being phased out (see also forums post about [Public API Changes](https://hypixel.net/threads/public-api-changes-february-2023.5266129/)).

Therefore, **API-related features _that require an API key_ will probably stop working in the foreseeable future**. I _don't_ currently plan to provide my own API backend system, so sooner or later the few features in Cowlection that require an API key will probably stop working.

However, there are some Discord bots (e.g. [SkyHelper](https://skyhelper.altpapier.dev/)), other bigger SkyBlock mods, and some websites that provide similar API-based player lookup functionality.

The affected features are the following:
1. `/moo stalk`: check online status & current game of a user
2. `/moo stalkskyblock`: check SkyBlock stats of a player
3. `/moo dungeon party` (= `/moo dp`): lookup armor and dungeons stats of each Dungeons party member

All other features of Cowlection *do not* require an API key and thus should be unaffected by the API-related changes.

### Removed
- Removed Cowlection 'Best friends' list:
  - Migrate your current Cowlection best friends with `/moo bestfriends`
  - Hypixel added their own 'Best friends' list quite a while ago: [see patch notes for 'Social Update'](https://hypixel.net/threads/social-update-online-status-best-friends-more.4638020/)
    - Hypixel's best friends list does basically the same, plus doesn't require *any* API requests
    - View best friends list: `/friend list best` or `/fl best`
    - Add or remove best friend: `/friend best <player name>`
- Removed Join & leave notifications toggle for friends, best friends, and guild members
  - use Hypixel's commands instead: 
      - `/friend notifications` to cycle through the available Friends notifications options, or `/settings` → Social Settings → Friend Notifications: All / Best / None 
      - `/guild notifications` to toggle Guild notifications, or `/settings` → Personal Guild Settings → Guild Notifications

### Fixed
- Bestiary Overview (`/moo config bestiary` + `/be`): adapted tooltip detection for newly added bestiary entries
- Pet exp in tooltips: fixed rare crash caused by unexpected NBT data typing
- Bazaar: fixed "Show items left to buy/sell" for buy/sell orders not working anymore
- Enchanted books: fixed "price converted to level 1 books", as enchantments are now sold on the Bazaar, and no longer inside the Auction house
  - works on "intermediate" Bazaar pages, so the 'overview' Bazaar pages that list all levels of a certain enchantment (GUI title starts with either `Enchantments ➜` or `Ultimate Enchantments ➜`)
  - (related config options: `/moo config enchantment`)
- `/moo analyzeChests`: lowest BINs are now stored as long values instead of integers (affects only a handful of items with very high BIN prices)

### Changed
- Dungeons overlay: now disabled by default (old config entries aren't modified)
- SkyBlock player lookup: removed 'last played/last profile save' as it's no longer part of the API
- Analyze island: added new Minion (Vampire) and updated texture IDs for minions that previously erroneously shared the same skin
- `/moo directory`: added 2nd parameter to open either `/config/cowlection` or `/mods/` directory
- some Hypixel API related changes regarding API key validation

## [1.8.9-0.15.1] - 22.12.2022
### Fixed
- Fixed Dungeons Party Finder player lookup when someone joins a party

## [1.8.9-0.15.0] - 23.10.2022
### Added

  - `/moo stalkskyblock`:
    - added stranded and bingo mode
    - added Social skill (exp wasn't available on the API before)
    - updated skill average calculation (carpentry is no longer a 'cosmetic' skill)
    - added new slayers (enderman + blaze)
  - `/moo analyzeIsland`: added new minions (mainly Crimson Isle related)
- `/moo analyzeIsland`:
  - Added chests and hopper counters
  - Added accumulating results: repeat the command and scan multiple areas of an island
- `/moo analyzeChests`: Chest Analyzer rework:
  - Added search
  - Added NPC sell prices (only used if an item has neither a Bazaar nor lowest BIN price, or if one of them is hidden)
  - Added 'deselect/hide item' = not calculated in total price sum (right click inside GUI)
  - Added list of coords for highlighted chests when searching for chests with a certain item (double click inside the GUI to search, hover the chat message to see coords)
  - Added info button (`[?]`)

### Changed

- `/moo search`: Allow empty search query (= returns all log entries between start and end date)
- `/moo stalkskyblock`: replaced "last played" with "last time *someone* played on the selected profile"
- Updated quick lookup for item prices and wiki: (`/moo config item`)
  - wiki: also added official wiki (use <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> to switch between Fandom and official wiki; default wiki key: <kbd>I</kbd> = info)
  - item prices: replaced stonks.gg with sky.coflnet.com (default key: <kbd>P</kbd> = price)
- Party Finder Rules Editor: increased character limit per rule from 32 to 255
- Dungeons overlay: removed outdated time penalty from overlay due to floor-based scoring
- (technical change: no longer fire `ClientChatReceivedEvent` when sending a mod-internal chat message, as too many other mods have had problems with it)

### Fixed

- Fixed various API related issues caused by updates since the last release of Cowlection:
  - determining the active/selected profile
  - Minecraft username lookup by uuid changed since username history API got removed
- Fixed GUI related issues caused by updates since the last release of Cowlection:
  - Fixed detection for `/bestiary` overview
- (technical fix: add support for [public Hypixel API SSL certificate changes](https://hypixel.net/threads/public-api-ssl-certificate-changes.5116193/))
